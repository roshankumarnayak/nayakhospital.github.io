How rapid prototyping and series of iterations was done at Technology Business Incubator (TBI) of Berhampur University and finally the first CPR Assist device of India “Sanjivani QCPR” was made.
                              The various government grants and funding available to promote innovation, was also discussed with the MBA students. Dr Badamali became a committee member of Entrepreneurship Development Cell of IIM Raipur to mentor the students and got felicitated by Dr KK Jain, Dean Academics and MrSatyendra Jain, Chief General Manager, IOCL.
